# Butterbean 2

This is the sequel to the first and the worst, the Discord bot that started the slip into software development. Thank you, WATTBA community for all your patience with this.

## Planning

I have  few wants:
1. Flask server with frontend for management.
  1. Flask-Discord and server roles to authenticate and authorize a user.
  1. Easier editing of discord welcome messages etc.
  1. I don't know frontend development so this is actually the hardest part.
1. Bot is a separate module that defines classes to interact with the discord API. 
  1. WelcomeScreen and message
  1. Role management and pronoun management
  1. Channel hiding 
  1. RSS Subscription Webhooks
  1. Automod

We can expand on this in time. This is just jotting stuff down for now.

## How to set up

So far, the only thing you really need is python3 and doing `pip install -r requirements.txt` That should install all necessary modules in your environment.
